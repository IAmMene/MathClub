    This page follows basic HTML structure and functionality.
    For full understanding and citation on why the document is structured as below, refer back to the index.html of this folder. Repeat comments will be avoided. 
    Only those features that differ from the index.html file will be commented on in this file. For example, the head, and header elements containing nav etc., are the exact same for each page and therefore will not be commented on throughout.

  <!-- Main element is used in order to help distinguish the different parts of the webpage from one another such as the Navigation header and the main text-->
  <main>
    <!-- The form element was used to represent a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information. 
      Form id is set to addNumbers in order to set a unique id to the form.
      The label and input element both serve to create a label and input field respectively. I have set the label to number1 to indicate that the user is to enter their first value.
      Then I set the input type as a number as it is required, and the required attribute is entered to ensure that the correct field is entered before submitting the form. 
      The break element is used in order to produce a break line in the text so that the two inputs and labels are differentiated by some white space on the webpage. 
      The same logic is applied to the input for the second input box. 
      Finally, a submitt button is created within the form following a similar format to the other input boxes.
      It acts as a submit button which is a button for submiting the form data to a form handler, which will be handlded by the JS.

      <!-- Once the form's data has been dealt with by the JS, a paragraph element is used to display the output of the JS once it has been calculated, nothing will be present on screen until 2 numbers have been inputed and the add button/submitt button pressed. 
        The p element is being used as a way to represent a block of text, and will be given the p element has been set to an id of result, the content of the p element will be dynamically updated by JS when the form is submitted.
