    This page follows basic HTML structure and functionality.
    For full understanding and citation on why the HTML document is structured as below, refer back to the index.html of this folder. Repeat comments will be avoided. 
    Only those features that differ from the index.html file will be commented on in this file. For example, the head, and header elements containing nav etc., are the exact same for each page and therefore will not be commented on throughout.-->

     <!-- Section element was again used in this section because of the external CSS stylesheet that was references, a dedicated and distinct box surrounding the input was the desire and therefore the section element was used again much like in the guessNum.html. 
      The form element was used to represent a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information. 
      Form id is set quadraticForm in order to set a unique id to the form to be accessed by js.
      The label and input element both serve to create a label and input field respectively. THe labels have been set to a, b, and c for the respective required inputs. 
      Then I set the input type as a number as it is required, and the required attribute is entered to ensure that the correct field is entered before submitting the form. 
      The same logic is applied to the input for the second input box as well as the third.
      Finally, a submitt button is created within the form following a similar format to the other input boxes.
      It acts as a submit button which is a button for submiting the form data to a form handler, which will be handlded by the JS.
