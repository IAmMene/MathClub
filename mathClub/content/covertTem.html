    This page follows basic HTML structure and functionality.
    For full understanding and citation on why the HTML document is structured as below, refer back to the index.html of this folder. Repeat comments will be avoided. 
    Only those features that differ from the index.html file will be commented on in this file. For example, the head, and header elements containing nav etc., are the exact same for each page and therefore will not be commented on throughout.

    <!-- The unordered list element is used here to define an unordered list, due to the way in which the missing.css file manipulates these ordered and unordered lists, I used this element to contain the input for the conversion. 
      An unordered list was also used so that the two input boxes could be consistently edited and related to one another on the HTML page. 
      The first line of the code sets the role of the ul and the class attribute assigns the CSS classes, f-switch and dense to the style of the list. 
      F-switch applies a Flexbox container that will swtich from row to column when the width of the individual descendant exceeds the width variable. 
      Dense is used to set the spacing between the elements. 
      The logic of the ul is followed and headings as well sa a li element are called on to form the input fields.
