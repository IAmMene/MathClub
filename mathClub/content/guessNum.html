    This page follows basic HTML structure and functionality.
    For full understanding and citation on why the HTML document is structured as below, refer back to the index.html of this folder. Repeat comments will be avoided. 
    Only those features that differ from the index.html file will be commented on in this file. For example, the head, and header elements containing nav etc., are the exact same for each page and therefore will not be commented on throughout.

    <!-- The section element is used to denote a generic standalone section of a document, in order to segment the magic number guessing game in the main element, I used sectin to differentiate it from the main body section.
      Section element always needs a heading so one smaller than the previous two headings was used. 
      The missing.css provides styling for section elements and this is why they are called on in this case and imbedded in the main element. 
      Much like the add2hums.html file, in order to create input the input element was called on in order to specify ids for the input gathered from the section portion of the HTML.
      The input has been set to a number type, and given the id of guess for JS to call on, the value or the number that will be seen in the textbox is 0 and the highest numbers that can be entered is set to 10 and the lowest is 1. 
      To create a working button, the button element is called on to create on on the webpage, it is set to id of submit so that it can be called on by JS to get the input.
